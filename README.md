# Divisible
C program that prompts user for three integer numbers, and verifies if the numbers are all divisible by the first number without a remainder and that the three numbers are in increasing order. The program returns an error code 0 if the numbers are divisible by the first number and in increasing order. It returns an error code of 1 if the numbers are not divisible but in increasing order, 2 if they are divisible but not increasing, 3 if the numbers are not divisible and not increasing. The program will also print a message explaining this status. The program terminates after performing this once. The program was screated by Stefan Wallin on 03/14/23.
